# Cowler Todo List

## Description

Cowler Todo List is a project initiated as a coding challenge during my time as a fresh graduate. It is designed to emulate a certain design aesthetic and functional requirements provided in a job application process. The frontend is built with React, leveraging the create-react-app tooling, and utilizes React's native context and state management. The backend is developed using Express to handle HTTP requests, providing a simple yet effective API for the todo list operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (Ensure you are using npm version 16, as the codebase is tailored for this version due to its age.)
## Frontend

## Usage 
Once the application is running, you can:

- Add new tasks to the todo list.
- View all the existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
